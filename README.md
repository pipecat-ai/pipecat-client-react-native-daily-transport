![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pipecat-ai/react-native-daily-transport)

The Pipecat client React Native Transport library exports a `RNDailyTransport` that has the [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) transport associated.

To connect to a bot, you will need both this SDK and the [`@pipecat-client/client-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pipecat-ai/client-js) to create an `RTVIClient`.

## Minimum OS/SDK versions

This package introduces some constraints on what OS/SDK versions your project can support:

- **iOS**: Deployment target >= 13
- **Android**: `minSdkVersion` >= 24

## Installation

Install `@pipecat-ai/react-native-daily-transport` along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i @pipecat-ai/react-native-daily-transport
npm i @daily-co/react-native-daily-js@^0.70.0
npm i @daily-co/react-native-webrtc@^118.0.3-daily.2
npm i @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^1.23.1
npm i react-native-background-timer@^2.4.1
npm i react-native-get-random-values@^1.11.0
```

If you are using Expo, you will also need to add the following dependencies:
```bash
npm i @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc@^10.0.0
npm i @daily-co/config-plugin-rn-daily-js@0.0.7
```

All the details about Expo can be found [here](https://github.com/daily-co/rn-daily-js-expo-config-plugin).

A full demo can be found [here](https://github.com/daily-demos/daily-bots-react-native-demo/)

## Quick Start

Instantiate an `RTVIClient` instance, wire up the bot's audio, and start the conversation:

```typescript
let voiceClient = new RTVIClient({
  transport: new RNDailyTransport(),
  params: {
    baseUrl: url,
    config: [
      {
        service: "tts",
        options: [
          { name: "voice", value: "79a125e8-cd45-4c13-8a67-188112f4dd22" },
        ],
      },
      {
        service: "llm",
        options: [
          { name: "model", value: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo" },
          {
            name: "initial_messages",
            value: [
              {
                role: "system",
                content:
                  "You are a assistant called ExampleBot. You can ask me anything. Keep responses brief and legible. Your responses will converted to audio. Please do not include any special characters in your response other than '!' or '?'. Start by briefly introducing yourself.",
              },
            ],
          },
          { name: "run_on_config", value: true },
        ],
      },
    ],
    requestData: {
      services: {
        llm: "together",
        tts: "cartesia",
      },
    },
    endpoints: {
      connect: "/start",
      action: "/action"
    }
  },
  enableMic: true,
  enableCam: false
})

await voiceClient.start()
```

## Documentation

Pipecat Client React Native implements a client instance that:

- Facilitates requests to an endpoint you create.
- Dispatches single-turn actions to a HTTP bot service when disconnected.
- Provides methods that handle the connectivity state and realtime interaction with your bot service.
- Manages media transport (such as audio and video).
- Provides callbacks and events for handling bot messages and actions.
- Optionally configures your AI services and pipeline.
